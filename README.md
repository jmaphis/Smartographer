## About

Smartographer is a map generation web app, by James Maphis.<br>
You currently can make dungeon, cave and world maps by pressing their respective buttons. <br>
To get a new map of the chosen type, press the refresh button.<br>
If you find a map you would like to save, you can create an account and sign in. then simply give the map a name, and hit save!<br>
(Currently Smartographer is just a proof of concept.  We cannot guarantee that user accounts and maps will not be deleted.)<br>
<br>
There is currently a rare bug which will cause the site to crash while trying to view a specific map type. <br>
To fix this, you can reset that map type by clicking the corresponding link below:<br>
